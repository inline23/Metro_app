#Metro_App
It allows users to select their starting and ending stations on the Cairo Metro network, view the ticket price, and see the total number of stations they will pass through.
If there are interchange stations along the route, the app will also display them.

Additionally, the app includes:

A feature to locate the nearest metro station to the userâ€™s current location.

A destination mode where the user can enter a specific address, and the app will suggest the nearest metro station to start from, as well as the station to exit at, along with the full route details.
